# Osu-tablet-area-detector
An automated area detector to find the best tablet area possible, this work using the logic of drawing the area while you play is like drawing the playing area with a pencil in your tablet but with a software


i've been trying to fix known issues

1-Area out of bounds


2-When an area is manually assigned it doesn't really match the area of the tablet happening with gaomon tablets
